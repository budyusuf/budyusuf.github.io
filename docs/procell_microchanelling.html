        <p class="service_descr">
            Our Procell "Microchanneling" treatment is microneedling... evolved!
            Procell's Micro-Channeling system is a minimally invasive treatment that transforms the look and feel of damaged skin to a smoother, and healthier looking skin.
            If you are considering a treatment to improve the texture, tone and elasticity of your skin Procell Microchanneling is a perfect solution for you. This procedure is suitable for all skin types and is a minimally invasive skin rejuvenation treatment which involves the use of a TGA registered mechanized stamper to create tiny, clean controlled skin injuries (microchannels) which in turn stimulates the production of new collagen and elastin. Procell’s Microchanneling device uses filaments made from surgical grade steel, small enough to fit into a hair follicle. This minimizes 
            damage to the epidermis for faster recovery.
            ProCell Therapies offers cutting-edge biotechnology to induce a breathtaking transformation to the appearance of the skin that can last a lifetime.
            The ProCell Microchanneling delivery serum uses highly concentrated human growth-factors serums derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells which are known to promote scarless healing in an anti-inflammatory environment. Amplifying your collagen response during microchanneling treatment.
            During the treatment, very small micro-needles penetrate the upper layers of your skin creating small, micro-injuries. These micro-injuries stimulate a natural healing response, which leads to the creation of new collagen. Over the course of several treatments, this repetitive healing process can create a new layer of collagen that can improve the overall appearance of your skin.
            We use powerful growth factors & cytokines for optimal skin health. Procell improves the appearance of aging skin, increases the vitality of your skin, and reduces the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, uneven skin tone, acne & acne scarring.

        <h3 style="text-align:left; margin-left:5%;">The Benefits of Procell Therapies Microchannelling</h3>
        
        <p class="service_descr">
            Procell Therapies Microchanneling is a minimally invasive non-surgical and non-ablative procedure for facial rejuvenation. A non-ablative procedure means that your epidermis (first layer of skin) remains preserved and intact. When you are comparing the effects and outcomes of Microneedling, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP), Platelet Rich Fibrin (PRF) and laser therapy, the benefits of Procell Therapies Microchanneling include no scratching or tearing of the skin and elimination of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (pigmentation of the skin due to skin trauma). 
            Procell Microchanneling is a procedure that punctures thousands of tiny holes, aka micro-channels, into your skin to generate collagen production. These tiny holes are ideal to soak up the ProCell stem cell serum which is an innovative technology that helps promote the growth of collagen and elastin. 
            We use the MD Microchannel Delivery Serum for all customers over 40 years of age as it contains double the growth factors and anti-aging, pro-healing and anti-inflammatory ingredients such as TGF-ß3 and IL-1. The MD Microchannel Delivery Serum provides faster results with shorter recovery times than the Pro serum which is suitable for all customers under 40 years of age.
            Ingredients include deionized water, stem cytokines (proprietary mixture of human bone marrow stem cell-derived growth factors and cytokines), hyaluronic acid, dehydroacetic acid and benzyl alcohol.  
            The MD serum contains human bone marrow-derived growth factors in a Hyaluronic acid suspension. Both elements occur naturally in the human body. There are no human, animal, or plant cells, DNA, blood, or any other foreign substances. The product has been used safely and effectively for over a decade.
            The main powerhouse in Procell serum is Stem Cytokines, which supports cellular renewal. When applied to the skin, the skin mimics the effect of having more stem cells. We lose most of these stem cells as we age. By middle age only a few percent remain compared to our youth and the remaining ones are less robust. The serum has potent regenerating properties to improve skin firmness, elasticity, and tone.
            This Dermascope 2022-2024 winning treatment thickens the epidermis by creating micro channels, these channels stimulate the healing response in your skin creating new fresh collagen as well as helping to absorb cosmeceutical serums and creams making them 300% more effective.

        <h3 style="text-align:left; margin-left:5%;">Why does skin age?</h3>
    
        <p class="service_descr">
            Our age, visibly and invisibly, every day. Sun damage, internal inflammation, chemicals, and even gravity all work against the youthful vitality of your skin.
            As we get older, our ability to repair this constant damage is diminished dramatically.
            Since fewer regenerative stem cells survive to carry on the work, slower, less robust healing and
            greater levels of inflammation are inevitable. <br><br>

        <h3 style="text-align:left; margin-left:5%;">How Does Procell Therapies Microchanneling Stimulate Cellular Activity?</h3>

        <p class="service_descr">
            A single Procell treatment creates hundreds of thousands of microchannels. In response to each micro-injury, an inflammatory healing process begins which initiates the formation of new collagen. Over time the repeated healing process begins which initiates the formation of new collagen. The repeated healing process improves the surface texture and overall appearance of the skin.
            Procell Microchannelling is a unique well-researched treatment for skin rejuvenation with numerous benefits including:
