        <ol style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">
            <li>There can be no numbing used during your sessions, so it is recommended you take Tylenol or Advil 1 hour prior to your appointment time, to help minimize any discomfort.</li>
            <li>Your hair and scalp need to be clean, dry, and free of any products and oils. Washing hair with shampoo a maximum of 8-10 hours prior is best.</li>
            <li>Please avoid sun exposure to your scalp in the days leading up to your treatment.  This will make your scalp extremely sensitive to work on.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3 style="text-align:left; margin-left:5%;">Hair Treatment Post Care:</h3>
        <ol style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">
            <li>Do not apply any products to hair or scalp for 24hrs</li>
            <li>Scalp may feel like a sunburn, use cold compresses if needed</li>
            <li>Use a fresh clean pillowcase</li>
            <li>Peeling and skin sloughing may occur for a few days after treatment</li>
            <li>Use a good quality Biotin shampoo and conditioner. If it also has Collagen even better.</li>
            <li>Let hair air dry whenever possible and avoid rubbing your towel aggressively on your head to dry it. This can cause breakage.</li>
            <li>Apply Aftercare Serum only to the treated areas - to clean hair.  If you only wash 3 days a week, only use the serum 3 days a week</li>
